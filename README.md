# AREA

AREA is an application development project designed to replicate the functionality of IFTTT. Its principle is straightforward: connecting actions and reactions across different services to automate workflows.

## Project Description

AREA's sole purpose is to make your life easier by automating tasks that can be troublesome or easily forgotten. For example, if you need to send yourself a weekly email to remind you to clean your desk, AREA can handle this task automatically.


> [!NOTE]
> Our product is friendly to the visually impared and the color blind.

## Installation

Our project relies on a Docker container to build. You only have to run these two commands to launch AREA:

```bash
sudo docker-compose build
```

```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If not working, make sure that your docker is running and that no other container is running on the port 8080 or 8081
